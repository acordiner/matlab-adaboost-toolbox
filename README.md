AdaBoost Toolbox for MATLAB
===========================

A toolbox for performing various forms of AdaBoost (including Discrete, Real and Gentle), written entirely in MATLAB. This was written as part of my [thesis](http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/864/). View a [presentation](https://thedeadbeef.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/toolbox_presentation.pdf) that provides a brief introduction to the toolbox and AdaBoost, or the [user manual](https://thedeadbeef.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/techreport_boosting.pdf) that provides a detailed explanation of the functionality.
